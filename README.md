I have always been interested in the horror genre, and more specifically the sound design aspect. For this reason, I wanted to create a soundscape to embody fear, and to do this, I thought to combine it with another one of my passions, game design. Using some youtube videos as reference for me to make my own unique experience, I created a simple horror game using Unity. In the game, the character walks through an art gallery while being chased by a monster. This simple game allowed me to showcase my skills with game design, and coupled with an original horror soundscape, my skills in music production. Using a Roland compact synthesizer and my violin with Logic Pro helped me create a mix of electronic synthwave music which incorporates a physical instrument. This proved to be a very fun challenge. Overall, I am happy with the end result, and I improved my skills in the areas of game design, coding in C#, and electronic music production.
